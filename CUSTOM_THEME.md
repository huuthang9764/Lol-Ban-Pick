# Custom Pick&Ban design
This documentation guides you trough the creation of your very own and fully customized pick&ban UI.

## Prerequisites
- Knowledge of web technologies (HTML, CSS and a bit JS)
- A development environment / IDE (e.g. Atom, WebStorm, Visual Studio Code, Sublime)
- NodeJS. Refer to the [README](README.md) on how to install that.
- Local setup of the backend (refer to [README](README.md) on how to install that). The frontend is not needed, since you'll create your own.
- Serve. Install it globally using ```npm install -g serve```.
